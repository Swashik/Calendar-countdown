Step 1: I will be writing a python program that read one line of the text file.
Step 2: I will write a python program that reads one line of the text file
Step 3 : I will split the date and event name from the line
Step 4: I will calculate how many days are pending in the event, from today. (You can google on how to do Date Arithmetic)
Step 5 -  I will print the line “X days to new year day”. Do not print if the event has already passed.
